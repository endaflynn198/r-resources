# Multiple Linear Regression
This is a detailed worked example of multiple linear regression in R. The analysis is based on a dataset that contains information on weight loss for a group of individuals. The topics covered include:

- Interpretation of the model coefficients
- Hypothesis testing
- Making predictions
- Interaction effects
- Model diagnostics
- ANOVA

- Note: GitHub's HTML preview does not render the Latex equations correctly. To view the report correctly, you can clone the repository and open the HTML file in a browser.

You can also run the analysis yourself by cloning the repository and running the `mlr_weight_loss.qmd` file.
