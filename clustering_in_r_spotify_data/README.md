# Quarto
The analysis is written in Quarto, and demonstrates some of the functionality it provides which allows for more aesthetically pleasing and interactive reports. These include:
- Code options (e.g. `echo`, `eval`, `results`)
- Code folding
- Floating table of contents
- Tabsets for code and output
