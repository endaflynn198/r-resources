# EDA & Simple Linear Regression
This is intended to be an exhaustive analysis of the data and the model which will be useful to students and individuals wishing to learn EDA in R or to revise SLR and related concepts. We will begin with an exploratory data analysis to understand the data and the relationship between the variables. We will then fit a simple linear regression model to the data and interpret the results - covering concepts such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, prediction intervals, residual standard error, and the coefficient of determination.
